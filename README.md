![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-WIP-yellow)  
This ontology is under active development  

**BoDi (Born-Digital Ontology)** is an extension of the Records in Contexts (RiC) ontology, designed to represent born-digital resources in personal archives. It integrates elements from PREMIS, PROV-O, and LRMoo, and introduces new classes and properties specifically tailored for born-digital archival materials. BoDi supports semantic interoperability and formalized reasoning over archival data.
